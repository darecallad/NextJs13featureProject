## Next.js 13

# Improved File-Based Routing

Next.js has always had a file-system based router built on the file system, but in Next.js 13, it has been improved to work more intuitively with folders.

# Folder-Based Dynamic Routes

In Next.js 13, you can create dynamic routes using folders. For example, if you have a file structure like this:

diff
Copy code
pages/
--| user/
-----| [id].js
The [id].js file inside the user folder will automatically be a dynamic route that matches user/1, user/2, etc.

# Linking Between Pages

To link between pages, you can use the Link component from next/link. For example:

javascript
Copy code
import Link from 'next/link'

function Navigation() {
return (

<nav>
<Link href="/user/1">
<a>User 1</a>
</Link>
<Link href="/user/2">
<a>User 2</a>
</Link>
</nav>
)
}

export default Navigation

# atch-All Routes

You can also create catch-all routes using folders. For example, if you have a file structure like this:

diff
Copy code
pages/
--| document/
-----| [...params].js
The [...params].js file inside the document folder will match any route like document/a, document/a/b, document/a/b/c, etc.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
